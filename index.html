			<h2 class="heading"> Was Freddie Mercury gay?</h2>
			<p> For most of Mercury's life, the wider world didn't accept gays and bisexuals. Born in 1946, he grew up at a time when same-sex attraction was considered a mental illness, a tragedy, a joke, or some combination of the three. 
				Even though never confirmed, he openly had serious relationships with both a man and a woman and had regular sexual encounters with both. In today's time he would be called bisexual.
		  </p>
			<h2 class="heading">What instruments did Freddie Mercury play?</h2>
			<p> Voice, piano, drums and guitar.
		  </p>
			<h2 class="heading">Did Freddie Mercury have any siblings?</h2>

			Yes, a sister Named Kashmira Bulsara.
		  </p>
		  <h2 class="heading">What was Mercury's zodiac sign?</h2>
			<p>
			Virgo
